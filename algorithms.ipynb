    "Besides merely being a finite set of rules that gives a sequence of operations for solving a specific type of problem, an algorithm has five important features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Finiteness**. An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of\n",
    "steps. Note, however, that the number of steps can become arbitrarily large. A procedure that has all of the characteristics of an algorithm except that it\n",
    "possibly lacks finiteness may be called a computational method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Definiteness**. Each step of an algorithm must be precisely defined; the actions to be carried out must be rigorously and unambiguously specified for each case The algorithms of this book will hopefully meet this criterion, but they are specified in the English language, so there is a possibility that the reader might not understand exactly what the author intended. To get around this difficulty, formally defined programming languages or computer languages are\n",
    "designed for specifying algorithms, in which every statement has a very definite\n",
    "meaning. Many of the algorithms of this book will be given both in English\n",
    "and in a computer language. An expression of a computational method in a\n",
    "computer language is called a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Input**. An algorithm has zero or more inputs: quantities that are given to it initially before the algorithm begins, or dynamically as the algorithm runs. These inputs are taken from specified sets of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Output**. An algorithm has one or more outputs: quantities that have a\n",
    "specified relation to the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Effectiveness**. An algorithm is also generally expected to be effective, in the sense that its operations must all be sufficiently basic that they can in principle be done exactly and in a finite length of time by someone using pencil and paper. Another example of a noneffective step is, “If 4 is the largest integer $n$ for which there is a solution to the equation $w^n + x^n + y^n = z^n$ in positive integers $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$, then go to step E4.” Such a statement would not be an effective operation until someone successfully constructs an algorithm to determine whether 4 is or is not the largest integer with the stated property.\n",
