    "The concept of mathematical induction should be distinguished from what is usually called inductive reasoning in science. A scientist takes specific observations and creates, by “induction,” a general theory or hypothesis that accounts for these facts; for example, we might observe the five relations in (1), above, and formulate (2). In this sense, induction is no more than our best guess about the situation; mathematicians would call it an empirical result or a conjecture.\n",

It is not just guesswork, but a conclusive proof of a statement; indeed, it is a proof of infinitely many statements, one for each n. It has been called “induction” only because one must first decide somehow what is to be proved, before one can apply the technique of mathematical induction. Henceforth in this book we shall use the word induction only when we wish to imply proof by mathematical induction."
